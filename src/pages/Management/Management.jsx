    <h1>Management</h1>
    <p>This page is here to give some general management advice that is most commonly advised to most patients going through any sort of physio rehab.</p>
    <div className="page-container">
    <h4>How much exercise should I be doing per week?</h4>
<p>On average, you should aim for 150 minutes of exercise each week. Breaking it up throughout the week makes it more manageable. It's important not to feel obligated to reach the 150-minute goal immediately. Starting with 30 minutes a week is a good beginning. Remember, any exercise is better than none.</p>

<h4>What are flare-ups?</h4>
<p>Flare-ups occur when your symptoms intensify, often indicating increased sensitivity rather than additional damage. They can last from a few hours to a week or two. Don't panic; flare-ups are a common part of rehabilitation and are manageable. If you experience a flare-up, identify recent activities that might have triggered it, such as increased unfamiliar activity. Acknowledge and adjust your approach for next time, either by doing less or pacing out the activity.</p>

<h4>How to manage flare-ups?</h4>
<p>During a flare-up, it's crucial to listen to your body and rest as needed. However, staying mobile within your limits is important. Gradually ease back into normal activities once symptoms begin to subside, avoiding a rush back to your regular routine. Pay close attention to your body and adjust your activities based on pain levels; on days with less pain, you can gradually increase your activity level.</p>

<h4>What if you experience increased pain during exercises?</h4>
<p>Initially, expect some discomfort when starting new exercises. Remember that pain does not necessarily indicate damage. If the discomfort is tolerable, continue the exercises at your own pace; they should become more comfortable over time. If you experience a high level of discomfort or pain, consider adapting the exercise, such as reducing repetitions. If the symptoms persist, it's advisable to discontinue that particular exercise while continuing with those that are more comfortable.</p>

<h4>How can I alleviate pain?</h4>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution for pain relief, and what works for one person may not work for another. Experiment with different methods to find what works best for you. Common approaches include using hot or cold packs. Wrap them in a towel and avoid direct skin contact, applying them for 15-20 minutes at a time, multiple times a day if needed.</p>

<h4>Should you use supports, e.g., knee supports, belts?</h4>
<p>Opinions on using supports vary among healthcare professionals. It's advisable not to rely on them if possible, as dependence can make it challenging for your body to function without them. However, it's acceptable to use them on particularly painful days or when engaging in strenuous activities. The emphasis is on strengthening muscles through exercises to provide natural joint support.</p>
