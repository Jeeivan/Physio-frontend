            Stand tall with your feet approximately hip-width apart and weight
            distributed evenly on both feet. Make sure the chair behind you is
            at a suitable distance from you. Bend your knees and hips and squat
            down onto the chair. Knees and toes should be pointing in the same
            direction. Sit down lightly and push back up to the starting
            position using your front thighs and buttock muscles. To make easier
            raise height of seat, for example by adding cushions to the chair.
